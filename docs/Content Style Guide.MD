# Content Style Guide

This guide defines how we write and present our brand’s content. It ensures a consistent voice, tone, and style, reflecting our ethos and supporting our narrative in every piece of communication—from blog posts to product UI text.

## Brand Voice & Tone

**Voice:**  
Confident, supportive, and forward-looking—like a skilled mentor encouraging you to bring ideas to life. We are knowledgeable but never condescending, excited but never chaotic.

**Tone Variations:**  
- **Product UI:** Helpful, concise, and direct. Avoid jargon, guide the user through steps.  
- **Marketing Materials:** Inspiring and visionary. Highlight possibilities, show empathy for user challenges.  
- **Documentation & Help Content:** Clear and instructive. Offer step-by-step guidance without assuming prior expertise.  

**Personality Traits:**
- **Encouraging:** We reassure users that complexity can be mastered and goals achieved.
- **Empathetic:** We understand user frustrations and frame our guidance to relieve them.
- **Clarity-First:** We prefer simple, direct language over buzzwords.

## Editorial Standards

**Sentence Structure & Length:**  
- Aim for short to medium-length sentences (under 20 words when possible).
- Use active voice (“You can build this” vs. “This can be built by you”).
- Avoid run-on sentences or overly complex phrasing.

**Grammar & Punctuation:**  
- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Oxford commas are encouraged for clarity.
- Keep punctuation minimal—use exclamation points sparingly.

**Vocabulary & Word Choice:**  
- Prefer plain language. For example, say “start” instead of “initiate.”
- Avoid overly technical terms in marketing material. If needed in documentation, define them clearly.
- Use consistent terminology for product features (e.g., always call it “Blueprint Creation,” never “Mapping Step”).

## Writing for Different Content Types

**Product UI Text (Buttons, Tooltips, Alerts):**  
- Be brief and specific: “Save Changes” rather than “Proceed.”
- Use verbs to guide action: “Create Prototype,” “View Results.”
- In tooltips, offer quick help: “Click to edit this section.”  
- Error messages: Empathetic and instructive: “Something went wrong. Try reloading the page or contact support if it persists.”

**Marketing & Landing Pages:**  
- Start headlines with a benefit: “Transform Your Idea into a Product in Minutes.”
- Subheadings can reinforce the value and add detail.
- Include short, punchy paragraphs and bullet points to improve scanability.
- Use stories or scenarios to help users imagine product benefits.

**Blog Posts & Thought Leadership:**  
- Keep a conversational tone.  
- Back claims with evidence or examples.  
- Introduce a topic by framing user challenges, then show how we address them.
- Include actionable takeaways or next steps at the end.

**Documentation & Help Guides:**  
- Provide step-by-step instructions with clear numbering or bullet points.
- Include screenshots or GIFs where helpful (reference visuals as “Below is a screenshot…”).
- Keep a logical flow: define terms, show how to perform tasks, end with troubleshooting tips.
- Avoid assumptions—explain even basic concepts if relevant.

## Specific Formatting & Consistency Rules

**Headings & Subheadings:**  
- Use sentence case: “How to create a blueprint” (not “How To Create A Blueprint”).
- Keep headings short and descriptive.
- H1 for main title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections. In product documentation, follow a logical heading hierarchy to guide readers.

**Lists & Bullets:**  
- Use bullets for steps or features.  
- Numbered lists for tasks with a specific order.
- Keep bullet points parallel in structure (e.g., start each with a verb if possible).

**Links & CTAs:**  
- Link text should describe what the user will find: “View Pricing” rather than “Click here.”
- For CTAs, use action-oriented text aligned with brand tone: “Start Building,” “Discover More,” “Try It Now.”

---

## Terminology & Product Names

- **Agents:** Always capitalize named agents (Seldon, Baley, Dors, Daneel, Giskard, Calvin) when referencing them as personas.
- **Brand Name:** Use the full brand name on first mention, then shorten if appropriate. For instance, “At Creator Labs, we…” and subsequently “Our platform…”
- **Features & Steps:** Refer to product stages by their established names (e.g., “Initial Understanding,” “Memory Enhancement”). Stay consistent—don’t alternate synonyms.

---

## Inclusive & Accessible Language

- Use gender-neutral pronouns when possible: “they” instead of “he” or “she.”
- Avoid idioms or slang that may not translate well internationally.
- Consider users of all skill levels—avoid making users feel “wrong” or “slow.” Focus on positive instruction.

**Example:**  
Instead of “Just click here if you’re stuck,” write “Click ‘Help’ to see more guidance.”

---

## Voice in Error & Empty States

- In error messages or empty states, acknowledge the user’s context.  
  - Error: “We couldn’t load your blueprint right now. Please refresh or try again later.”  
  - Empty state: “You haven’t created any prototypes yet. Click ‘New Prototype’ to begin.”

Keep the tone calm and reassuring. Offer a next step or solution.

---

## Maintaining Consistency

- Check new copy against this guide before publishing.
- If unsure about wording, favor simplicity and clarity.
- Keep a shared glossary of terms and phrases (in a separate Markdown file) to ensure consistency in product naming and feature descriptions.

---

## Do’s & Don’ts

**Do:**  
- Do write like you’re guiding a friend through a task.  
- Do break down complex topics into simpler explanations.  
- Do highlight benefits before features.

**Don’t:**  
- Don’t use overly formal, academic language.  
- Don’t patronize users or imply they should know something they don’t.
