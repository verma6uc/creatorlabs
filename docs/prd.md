# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

**Purpose:**  
This PRD sets the foundation for our product’s next development cycle. It details the features, user stories, flows, and technical specifications required to deliver a coherent, valuable product experience. By following these requirements, we ensure that every build aligns with user needs (as identified in our personas and journey maps), brand ethos, and long-term strategic goals.

**Scope:**  
This PRD focuses on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that includes the essential steps from initial idea input to generating a functional prototype. Future iterations (post-MVP) will expand features, integrations, and refinement capabilities.

**Intended Audience:**  
Product managers, UX designers, developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders who need a clear, actionable roadmap to guide design, coding, testing, and deployment.

## High-Level Goals

1. **Empower Non-Technical Creators:** Make it simple for entrepreneurs, product managers, and UX designers to turn concepts into working prototypes.
2. **Guided Creation via AI Agents:** Provide strategic, design, backend, integration, and quality guidance throughout the build process.
3. **Rapid Iteration & Validation:** Enable quick adjustments to features and flows, so users can validate and improve their product early.

**Success Metrics:**
- At least 3 actionable recommendations generated per project.
- Users report higher clarity on what to build first (via feedback survey).

---

### 3. Blueprint Creation

**Description:**  
The platform provides a blueprint including navigation maps, interaction design, and technical architecture. Users can customize these before finalizing.

**User Stories:**
- *As Alex*, I want a visual map showing my app’s screens and how users move between them.
- *As Priya*, I need to see backend architecture suggestions, like how data flows through the system.

**Requirements:**
- Visual navigation diagram auto-generated from features.
- Editable interaction flowcharts (drag-and-drop interface).
- Suggest database schema or API endpoints where relevant.

**Success Metrics:**
- Users create or edit at least one navigation map successfully.
- Reduced confusion in setup phase, measured by fewer support requests about “how to connect screens.”

---

### 4. Visual PRD Generation

**Description:**  
A visual Product Requirements Document that combines state diagrams, user flow mapping, page layouts, and component specs into a shareable, human-readable format.

**User Stories:**
- *As Jordan*, I can quickly assemble a visual PRD to show clients or team members.
- *As Priya*, I can export the PRD as a PDF or share a link with stakeholders for review.

**Requirements:**
- Auto-generate a PRD with all previously defined elements (features, flows, UI components).
- Allow editing of component labels, adding notes, and customizing layouts.
- Export options: PDF, web link, and integration with collaboration tools (e.g., Slack).

**Success Metrics:**
- Increase in shareable PRDs created (track number of exports/links created).
- Positive feedback from stakeholders on clarity of PRD (post-presentation survey).

---

### 5. Development Kickstart (Code Generation & Integration Setup)

**Description:**  
Daneel and Giskard assist in generating starter code and connecting components, bridging UI and backend logic.

**User Stories:**
- *As Alex*, even without coding skills, I want a basic prototype running to demonstrate functionality.
- *As Priya*, I want initial code scaffolding that developers can then refine.

**Requirements:**
- Generate starter front-end and back-end code snippets based on blueprint & PRD.
- Provide integration recommendations (e.g., “Use X service for authentication”).
- One-click download of a starter code repository or a GitHub integration.

**Success Metrics:**
- At least 50% of users who reach this stage generate code successfully.
- Reduction in developer onboarding time as measured by interviews or surveys.

### 6. Launch & Iteration Tools

**Description:**  
Calvin ensures quality checks (basic performance tests, recommended improvements). Users can run a quick test pass and share prototypes with testers.

**User Stories:**
- *As Alex*, I can quickly launch my MVP and gather early feedback.
- *As Priya*, I can share a test environment link with my team and collect actionable insights.

**Requirements:**
- Basic performance check on generated code (e.g., load time, responsiveness).
- A feedback collection form embedded in the prototype preview.
