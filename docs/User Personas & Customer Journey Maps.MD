# User Personas & Customer Journey Maps

This document outlines our key user personas and the typical journeys they undertake when interacting with our platform. By understanding who our users are, what they need, and how they move through each stage of engagement, we can design, build, and communicate more effectively.

## Why Personas & Journey Maps Matter

- **Empathy & Alignment:** They help everyone on the team—from developers to marketers—align around who we’re serving and why.
- **Informed Decisions:** Roadmaps, features, and messaging are guided by real user behaviors, not guesses.
- **Continuous Improvement:** As we learn more about users, we refine these personas and journeys, ensuring the platform evolves with actual user needs.

## Core User Personas

We focus on three primary personas, each representing a key user segment. These personas draw on our brand ethos (clarity, collaboration, adaptability) and ensure our platform supports a range of experience levels.

### Persona 1: The Visionary Entrepreneur

**Name:** Alex  
**Role/Context:** A solo entrepreneur or small startup founder with a big idea but limited technical skills.

**Profile:**
- **Background:** Innovative and business-minded, Alex knows the industry problem they want to solve but struggles to build a prototype due to a lack of coding expertise.
- **Goals:** Quickly validate concepts, impress potential investors or early adopters, and iterate rapidly without huge technical overhead.
- **Challenges:** Limited time, resources, and technical knowledge. Overwhelmed by complexity in product development.
- **Motivations:** Gain credibility, speed to market, and the ability to pivot easily based on feedback.
- **Tech Comfort:** Moderate. Comfortable with basic online tools but not professional coding environments.

**What They Need From Us:**
- Straightforward guidance (Seldon & Baley providing strategic clarity).
- Intuitive interface components (Dors ensuring easy UI flows).
- Rapid prototyping tools (Daneel & Giskard handling backend logic and integrations behind the scenes).
- Clear visual outputs (Calvin ensuring quality and consistent refinement).

### Persona 2: The In-House Product Manager

**Name:** Priya  
**Role/Context:** A product manager at a mid-sized company tasked with launching a new AI-driven feature or product line.

**Profile:**
- **Background:** Skilled at aligning teams and translating business needs into product requirements. Usually works with designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Goals:** Get from conceptual specs to a working prototype quickly to gain internal buy-in and proceed to full development.
- **Challenges:** Balancing stakeholder expectations, managing tight deadlines, and ensuring technical feasibility.
- **Motivations:** Efficiency in the development process, reducing miscommunication, validating product direction before heavy investment.
- **Tech Comfort:** High. Familiar with product tools, agile methodologies, and some technical concepts.

- Clear feature specification tools (Blueprint Creation step).
- Collaboration features (Integration steps powered by Giskard) enabling multiple stakeholders’ input.
- Documentation and guidance (Calvin’s QA standards) that help align the team.
- Confidence that the prototype aligns with market/user research (Baley’s insights) and strategic vision (Seldon’s direction).

### Persona 3: The Independent UX Designer

**Name:** Jordan  
**Role/Context:** A freelance UX designer working on various client projects, often needing to produce interactive prototypes.

**Profile:**
- **Background:** Skilled in user flows, wireframes, and usability principles but may not code extensively.
- **Goals:** Quickly turn UX concepts into interactive prototypes that clients can experience, gather feedback fast.
- **Challenges:** Translating static mockups into something testable without spending weeks coding. Ensuring design consistency.
- **Motivations:** Impress clients, stand out from competitors, speed in iteration, and smooth integration of frontend components.
- **Tech Comfort:** High on design tools (Figma, Sketch), moderate with development tools.

**What They Need From Us:**
- Easy-to-use UI libraries (Dors’s influence on style and patterns).
- Rapid iteration loops to update designs on the fly (Daneel & Giskard ensuring backend integration just works).
- Clarity in how to connect user flows to functional prototypes (Seldon’s strategic mapping).
- Reliability and polish (Calvin’s QA checks ensuring a professional deliverable).

## Customer Journey Maps

Each persona’s journey from discovering our platform to achieving ongoing success typically follows a pattern of phases. We detail these stages, highlight user thoughts and emotions, and identify touchpoints and opportunities for improvement.

### Stages in the Journey

1. **Awareness:** The user becomes aware of our platform through marketing, word-of-mouth, or industry articles.
2. **Consideration:** The user explores our website, reads about our AI agents, and evaluates how well it fits their needs.
3. **Onboarding & Setup:** The user signs up, sets initial product parameters, and creates their first prototype.
4. **Iterating & Building:** The user refines features, adjusts UI flows, and integrates additional components.
5. **Validation & Launch:** The user finalizes the prototype, tests it, and either presents it to stakeholders or launches it publicly.
6. **Feedback & Growth:** The user gathers feedback, iterates further, and scales their product, returning to earlier steps as needed.
